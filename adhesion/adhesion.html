    adhesion.html
    This snippet shows the basic HTML structure required to use adhesion.js.

    1. Include adhesion.js script file or copy the javascript inline
    2. Create a div for your banner. You're not required to have both header/footer
       banners on your page but the div should be an immediate child of the body tag
       so other styling doesn't affect positioning. Note: If you change the class
       name to something other than 'adHeader'/'adFooter', make sure to make the
       corresponding change to the configured values in adhesion.js
    3. Set the width and height of adHeader/adFooter to match the size of the
       banner you plan to show.
    4. (Recommended) Include the meta viewport tag. This is typically already
       present on most mobile optimized websites which is where mobile banners are
       best suited. If you include this viewport tag, you can use the 'width: 100%'
       css styling on your banners and have them properly handle both device
       orientations.
