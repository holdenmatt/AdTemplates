adhesion.js

This script takes a banner div (indiciated by a class name) and docks it to
either the top or bottom of a mobile device screen. See adhesion.html for the
basic HTML and CSS that should be included with this script.

This package contains the following files:
- adhesion.js - The actual script
- adhesion.html - A barebones example of the typical HTML structure required to
                  enable the banner
- adhesion-example.html - A functional example of using adhesion.js which can be
                          used for device testing.
- fixed.html - An example of the position:fixed CSS solution supported on newer
               Android and iOS devices. This is purely for illustrative
               purposes. If you want to simplify your banner code, this will
               give you the most coverage for the smallest addition to your
               site (see fixed.html for device coverage details).
- onscroll.html - An example of the javascript scroll event solution for support
                  on older iOS devices. This is purely for illustrative
                  purposes.
